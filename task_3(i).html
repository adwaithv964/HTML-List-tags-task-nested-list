                <p>
                    Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines elements of statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze large amounts of data, uncover patterns, and make informed decisions. Data science plays a critical role in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, where data-driven decision-making is essential.

                <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
                <p>
                    Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. Cyber security encompasses various areas including network security, application security, information security, and operational security.
